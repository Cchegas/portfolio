                <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
                <br>
                <h4>A 1-D version of the classic Pac-Man Arcade game where the goal is to collect all of the pellets to gain as high of a score as possible and traverse the next levels after collecting each pellet. There is also a ghost chasing you around to prevent you from eating all the pellete. However, by eating fruits in the game, you will be given the time to try eat the ghost to help you beat the level.
                </h4>
                <br>
                <h3>Objectives:</h3>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enhance the 1-D Pacman game by adding a PHP server component to my Pacman GitHub code repository, building on models developed during lab sessions.</li>
                    <li>Expose the Pacman game functionality through a JSON API and updated the JavaScript to make AJAX calls to the newly created API.
                    </li>
                    <li>All game state is stored on the PHP server using PHP $_SESSION, and the HTML/CSS/JavaScript focuses solely on displaying the current state of the game. The JavaScript does not calculate scores or track progress; it simply displays the current state.</li>
                    <li>Implemented a game leaderboard showing the top 10 scores. For simplicity, this information is also stored in the PHP $_SESSION
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
